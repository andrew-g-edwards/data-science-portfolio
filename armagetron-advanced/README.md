# Armagetron Advanced SBMM Algorithm
I was tasked with creating a skill-based match making algorithm for multi-player online indie game, Armagetron Advanced. The main game-mode is a competitive 6v6 "Control" type called Fortress. Since the community for this game is smaller than commercially successful games, the skill-set represented in your average 12 person lobby can be very diverse. Random teammates was too imbalanced, and the game lacked infrastructure for a captain system. 

I built an algorithm that sorts the entire player base based on performance-driven skill indicators, and separates players into 7 categories of play-style. When 12 players join the Queue to play, my algorithm generates evenly matched teams with options to reroll the teams or substitute in a player.
