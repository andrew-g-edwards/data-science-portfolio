# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains a catalog of Data Analytics/Science projects completed by me, for academic, professional, self-learning, and hobby purposes.

## Technical Skills Utilized
- Python
- Data Cleaning and Analysis: PANDAS, Google Sheets
- Data Visualization: Tableau, Seaborn, Matplotlib, plotly
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau Dashboards
- API Data Pulling: Discord, Spotify

## Contents
- [Armagetron Advanced](https://github.com/andrew-g-edwards/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/armagetron-advanced)
  - Developed a skill-based match making algorithm for a multi-player online game. Used gameplay data from the server logs to analyze the entire player base at large and draw distinction between skillset to create a hierarchy of rankings. My python script then uses those buckets of players to sort match making queues into balanced teams. 
- [Life Data Analysis](https://github.com/andrew-g-edwards/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/life-data-analysis)
  - I track data about my everyday life (sleep, mood, habits, weather, etc) since April 2022 and use it investigate causation and correlation between variables and to process into insightful visualizations using Python libraries and Tableau. I created a [heatmap calendar for the year 2023](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrew.g.edwards/viz/lifedata2023/MOOD) as well as an initial [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrew.g.edwards/viz/Life-Data/UPKEEP?publish=yes) for an earlier dataset.
- [Top 100 Spotify Analysis](https://github.com/andrew-g-edwards/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/top-100-spotify-analysis)
  - Myself and two friends each created a playlist of our favorite 100 songs of all time. I wrote a Python script using the Spotify API to to pull data from each playlist, scrubbing it for meaningful insights, then exporting into a workable csv. Data was aggregated and processed in Google Sheets. Data was analyzed using Python (PANDAS) and visualization libraries.
- [World Cup Analysis](https://github.com/andrew-g-edwards/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/world-cup-analysis)
  - An exploratory analysis of [two datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/fifa-world-cup), comparing different nations' successes in the world's largest sporting tournament, as well as specific characteristics of each tournament. A visualized history of world cup placement.
- Spotify Dataset Analysis [from [kaggle.com]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lehaknarnauli/spotify-datasets)
  - An exploratory analysis of a large dataset, using several different Python libraries and visualization mediums.
