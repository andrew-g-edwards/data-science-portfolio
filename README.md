- [Top 100 Spotify Analysis](https://github.com/andrew-g-edwards/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/top-100-spotify-analysis)
  - Myself and two friends each created a playlist of our favorite 100 songs of all time. I wrote a Python script using the Spotify API to to pull data from each playlist, scrubbing it for meaningful insights, then exporting into a workable csv. Data was aggregated and processed in Google Sheets. Data was analyzed using Python (PANDAS) and visualization libraries.
