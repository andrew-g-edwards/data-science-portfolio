- Top 100 Spotify Analysis
  - Myself and two friends each created a playlist of our favorite 100 songs of all time. I wrote a Python script to pull this data from each playlist, scrubbing it for meaningful insights, then exporting to csv. Data was aggregated and processed in Google Sheets. Data was analyzed using Python (PANDAS) and visualization libraries.
