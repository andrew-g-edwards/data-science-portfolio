# Life Data
Starting April 2022, I started tracking data about my everyday life, including mood, sleep, appetite, exercise, socializing, time spent outdoors, looking at a screen, working, alcohol and nicotine use, hygienic habits, the temperature, and the weather. I store all of this data in a Google Sheet with informative pivot tables, subsets, and formatting.

The analysis aims to explore questions:
- Which attributes of a day seem correlate with mood?
- Which attributes imply causation to others?
- Which attributes have changed over time and in what way?
- What are the implications of weather and temperature on my everyday behavior and decision-making?
- How can I implement these discoveries to contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle?
