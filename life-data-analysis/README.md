# Life Data
Starting April 2022, I started tracking data about my everyday life, including mood, sleep, appetite, exercise, socializing, time spent outdoors, looking at a screen, working, alcohol and nicotine use, hygienic habits, the temperature, and the weather. I store all of this data in a Google Sheet with many infomative pivot tables and subsets of the data. 

NOV 14th, 2022 - Submitted an analysis of 7 months of data.
