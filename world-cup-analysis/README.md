# World Cup Data
Joined two datasets ([1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/fifa-world-cup?select=worldcups.csv), [2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bartoszwajman/wc-overall)) to explore the history of the World Cup tournament. Visualizations depict how the game has evolved and how the tournament has grown in both size of team and fan attendance. Visualizations also track the competiveness and history of successful nations throughout the tournaments.
