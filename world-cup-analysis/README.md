# World Cup Data
Joined two datasets ([1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/fifa-world-cup?select=worldcups.csv), [2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bartoszwajman/wc-overall)) to explore the history of the World Cup tournament and create meaningful visualizations.

Analysis aims to investigate:
 - How has the tournament grown over time in terms of team and fan attendance?
 - How have scoring patterns evolved over time? Are there measurable statistics that reflect changes in the way the game has been played?
 - Which nations have won the most over time?
 - Which nations have placed most consistently over time?
