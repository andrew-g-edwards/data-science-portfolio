# Friends' Top 100 Songs, Analyzed
Two friends (Christian, Bobby) and I (Andrew) individually made a playlist of our favorite 100 songs of all time. I scripted a Python API call from Spotify to pull the data and scrub it into a workable dataframe, extracting key insights and processing important fields. Exporting each dataframe as a clean csv, I then aggregated the [data in Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h7DlHR26KapXuDXrwCqhOSztO7JiRVJXBU3OQfUKLUs/edit?usp=sharing) creating pivot tables and formatting data to see where our tastes overlapped, and what characteristics those songs shared. I then used various Python libraries inside a Jupyter Notebook to create interesting visualizations from my findings.
